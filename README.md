A plugin for your agentic framework that optimizes code through experiments

You give it a codebase. It discovers metrics to optimize, sets up the evaluation, and starts running experiments in a loop -- trying things, keeping what improves the score, throwing away what doesn't.

*Inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch)* -- where an LLM runs training experiments autonomously to beat its own best score. Autoresearch is a pure hill climb: try something, keep or revert, repeat on a single branch. Evo adds structure on top of that idea:

- **Tree search over greedy hill climb.** Multiple directions can fork from any committed node, so exploration doesn't collapse to one path.
- **Parallel semi-autonomous agents.** Spawn multiple subagents and run them simultaneously, each in its own git worktree. Each subagent reads traces, formulates hypotheses, and can run multiple iterations within its branch.
- **Shared state.** Failure traces, annotations, and discarded hypotheses are accessible to every agent before it decides what to try next.
- **Gating.** Regression tests or safety checks can be wired up as a gate. Experiments that don't pass get discarded.
- **Observability.** A dashboard to monitor your experiments.
- **Benchmark discovery.** The `discover` skill explores the repo, figures out what to measure, and instruments the evaluation.


Runs on Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, Opencode, or Pi. Experiments run locally or on remote sandboxes — Modal, E2B, Daytona, AWS, Azure, SSH.

## Try it

Two commands:

```
/evo:discover     # one-time code discovery: figures out benchmarks and creates gates against unintended changes
/evo:optimize     # run the loop
```

`discover` asks what to optimize, the benchmark command, and the metric direction. Skip the questions by seeding the answer:

```
/evo:discover make the JSON parser at src/parser.py faster
```

Pass `optimize` parameters as `key=value` after the skill name:

```
/evo:optimize subagents=3 budget=10 stall=3
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subagents` | 5 | Parallel subagents per round |
| `budget` | 5 | Max iterations each subagent can run within its branch |
| `stall` | 5 | Consecutive rounds with no improvement before auto-stopping |

Invocation syntax is host-specific: `/evo:` on Claude Code, `$evo` on Codex, natural language on Hermes, Opencode, OpenClaw, and Pi.

## Install

```bash
# 1. evo CLI
uv tool install evo-hq-cli

# 2. Host CLI (if you don't already have it)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code     # or @openai/codex, openclaw, @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

# 3. Plugin + host hooks
evo install <host>     # claude-code | codex | hermes | opencode | openclaw | pi
```

`evo install <host>` installs the plugin into the host's marketplace and stages the hooks evo needs to talk to in-flight subagents. Verify with `evo doctor <host>`.

For remote backends, install with the matching provider extra: `uv tool install 'evo-hq-cli[modal]'` (or `[e2b]`, `[daytona]`, `[aws]`, `[azure]`, `[all]`).

### Codex hook trust

Codex requires manual approval for plugin hooks. After install, run `/hooks` inside codex to trust evo's hooks — or pass `--trust-hooks` to `evo install codex` to skip the prompt.

## How it works

### Parallel

The orchestrator dispatches subagents in parallel. Each runs in its own isolated workspace, picks up shared state (failure traces, annotations, discarded hypotheses), forms a hypothesis, edits, and runs the benchmark. A subagent with iteration budget remaining continues on its branch within the same round when its prior edit warrants a follow-up.

### Frontier strategy

After each round, the orchestrator selects which committed branch to extend next. Available strategies:

- **argmax** — extend the highest-scoring branch
- **top_k** — round-robin among the K best
- **epsilon_greedy** — best most of the time, random sometimes
- **softmax** — sample weighted by score
- **pareto_per_task** — keep specialists the aggregate hides, inspired by [GEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457)

Configure in the dashboard's Frontier tab, which lists each strategy's parameters.

### Cross-cutting scans

Between rounds, [RLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)-inspired scan subagents read trace batches in parallel and surface compound failure patterns: gate-failure intersections, shared root causes across traces. Findings land in shared state, which the next round's subagents read at startup.

### Gates

evo introduces **gates**: pass/fail checks that run on every experiment. An experiment that fails a gate is discarded even if its score beats the current best. Without gates, the search will find ways to return a constant, skip work, or trade correctness for speed.

Any command that exits zero on pass and non-zero on fail qualifies as a gate: a test suite, an invariant script, a score floor on a held-out slice of the benchmark. Gates inherit down the experiment tree: a gate registered at the root runs on every descendant. Narrower gates can be attached to specific branches.

When `discover` builds a benchmark from scratch, it attaches a held-out-slice score-floor gate automatically. When the benchmark already exists in the repo, gates are opt-in.

## Where experiments run

| Backend | Where | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **worktree** *(default)* | local git worktree per experiment | included |
| **pool** | reuse a fixed set of local workspaces | included |
| **ssh** | your own SSH host | included |
| **modal** | Modal serverless cloud | `uv tool install 'evo-hq-cli[modal]'` |
| **e2b** | E2B cloud sandboxes | `uv tool install 'evo-hq-cli[e2b]'` |
| **daytona** | Daytona cloud workspaces | `uv tool install 'evo-hq-cli[daytona]'` |
| **aws** | AWS EC2 sandboxes | `uv tool install 'evo-hq-cli[aws]'` |
| **azure** | Azure VMs | `uv tool install 'evo-hq-cli[azure]'` |

Pick and configure in the dashboard's Backend tab.

## Dashboard

The dashboard starts automatically with `/evo:discover` (or `evo init`) and prints the URL in chat:

```
Dashboard live: http://127.0.0.1:8080 (pid 12345)
```

If `8080` is in use, evo increments to the next free port (`8081`, `8082`, …) and prints it. Subsequent runs reuse the chosen port. Start it manually with:

```bash
uv run --project /path/to/evo/plugins/evo evo dashboard --port 8080
```

## Upgrading

```bash
evo update <host>                    # host: claude-code | codex | hermes | opencode | openclaw | pi
evo update <host> --version 0.4.1    # pin to a release
```

See `evo update --help` for `--force`, `--scope`, and additional flags.

### Migrating from v0.4.0 or earlier

Reinstall the CLI and refresh the host plugin cache:

```bash
uv tool install --force evo-hq-cli && evo update --force
```

`--force` wipes the host plugin cache and reinstalls, working around [anthropics/claude-code#14061](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14061): `/plugin update` returns success but does not replace cached plugin files.

### Testing a pre-release (alpha)

`uv` and `pip` skip pre-releases by default. To install an alpha, pin both the CLI version and the host plugin tag:

```bash
uv tool install --force 'evo-hq-cli==0.4.1a2' && \
  evo update --version 0.4.1-alpha.2 --force
```

Substitute the target alpha version. The CLI uses PEP 440 form (`0.4.1a2`); the marketplace tag uses the dash form (`v0.4.1-alpha.2`).

## Dev install

For development on evo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evo-hq/evo
cd evo
uv tool install --editable plugins/evo
```
