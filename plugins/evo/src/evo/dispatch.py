"""Explorer-cache infrastructure for `evo dispatch`.

The orchestrator never imports this module directly; it goes through the
`evo dispatch` CLI verb (added in a follow-up). This module owns:

* the on-disk schema for cached explorer sessions
  (`.evo/<active-run>/explorers/<parent_id>.json`)
* the predicates that decide when a cached explorer can be reused
* hash helpers used by those predicates
* the EXPLORE-phase user-message template the explorer subprocess sees

Subprocess spawning lives in per-host modules (`hosts/claude_fork.py`, etc.),
which call `_ensure_explorer` and consume its handle.
