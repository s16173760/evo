"""Fetch the platform-native evo-hook-drain binary from the GitHub release.

The hook script is a small Rust binary (~330 KB) built natively for each
platform in CI. Binaries ship as GitHub Release assets, NOT in the plugin
git tree (keeps the repo small + lets users install from `main` without
binaries present). Every host's `install(args)` calls
`ensure_hook_drain_binary(plugin_root)` to populate the plugin's bin/
directory before hooks.json's command path is exercised.

Idempotent: re-fetch only when the on-disk binary is missing or doesn't
match the installed evo-hq-cli version.
