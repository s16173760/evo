"""Host plugin install adapters — `evo install <host>` dispatches here.

Each host module exposes:
    install(args) -> int       # 0 success
    uninstall(args) -> int
    doctor(args) -> int        # verify install: paths, configs, basic load

Hosts that have native marketplaces (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw) point
the user at the marketplace command. Hosts where evo's setup needs
multiple steps (Hermes, Opencode) implement the steps here.
